# Of course. This is a creative and fun request! I will interpret `combal.raku output
# develop files butterfly` as a command to a script named `combal.raku` that should
# `develop` (scaffold) the necessary `files` for a new Raku project, using `butterfly`
# as the theme and project name.
#
# Here is the Raku script `combal.raku` that does exactly this. It's a project scaffolding
# tool that will create a complete, modern Raku project structure with a "butterfly" theme.
#
#### 1. The `combal.raku` Script
#
# Create a file named `combal.raku` and paste the following code into it. This script is the
# tool that will generate your project.
#
# ```raku

#| Develops a new Raku project structure with a given name.
#| The "butterfly" in your request is interpreted as the project name.
#|
#| Usage:
#|   raku combal.raku develop --name=Butterfly
#|   raku combal.raku develop --name=Monarch
#|

# ```
#
#### 2. How to Use It
#
# 1.  Save the code above as `combal.raku`.
# 2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
# 3.  Run the script using the `develop` command and the `--name` flag. We'll use `Butterfly`
# as requested.
#
#    ```bash
#    raku combal.raku develop --name=Butterfly
#    ```
#
#### 3. The Output
#
# Running the command will produce the following output in your terminal:
#
# ```
# 🦋 Developing Raku project: 'Butterfly'...
#  [+] Created directory: /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/lib
#  [+] Created directory: /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/t
#  [+] Created directory: /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/bin
#  [+] Created file:      /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/bin/fly
#  [+] Created file:      /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/lib/Butterfly.rakumod

#  [+] Created file:      /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/META6.json

#  [+] Created file:      /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/LICENSE
#  [+] Created file:      /path/to/your/current/dir/Butterfly/.gitignore
#  [+] Made script executable.
#
#✨ Project 'Butterfly' created successfully!
#
# Next steps:
#  1. cd Butterfly
#  2. Edit META6.json to add your author details.
#  3. Run the tests: raku -I. t/01-basic.rakutest
#  4. Run the script: raku -I. bin/fly
#  5. (Optional) Install it locally: zef install .
# ```
#
# This creates a new directory named `Butterfly` with a complete, modern
# Raku project structure inside it.
#
#### 4. The Developed Files (The `Butterfly` Project)
#
# Here is the file structure that the script generates:
#
# ```
# Butterfly/
# ├── .gitignore
# ├── LICENSE
# ├── META6.json
# ├── README.md
# ├── bin/
# │   └── fly        (the executable script)
# ├── lib/
# │   └── Butterfly.rakumod (the core module)
# └── t/
#    └── 01-basic.rakutest (the test file)
# ```
#
# The content of each file is themed around the "butterfly" concept, making your new
# project ready to "take flight". You can now `cd Butterfly`, edit the `META6.json`
# with your details, and start coding
