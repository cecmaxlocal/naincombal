**naincombal** is a modern development project dedicated to the **Cobol and Raku Community**. It provides development
files and tools, centered around the **IDECombal** concept, to bridge the gap between the legendary stability of COBOL
and the modern expressiveness of Raku.

The **Butterfly (🦋)** is our symbol, representing the transformation and modernization of legacy systems with powerful
new tools.

## ✨ Project Philosophy

Our goal is to create a symbiotic environment where COBOL's robustness and Raku's concurrency and rich feature set can
coexist and empower developers. We believe in modernizing workflows without discarding the decades of value locked in
COBOL applications. **IDECombal** is the conceptual framework for the tools we develop to achieve this vision.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Raku installed on your system. You can get it from [raku.org](https://raku.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>/naincombal.git
   cd naincombal
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   zef --deps-only install .
   ```

3. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   prove -e raku -vr t/
   ```

## 📂 Project Structure

The project directory is organized to support both development and community contributions. Here is an overview of the
key directories you provided:

```
./naincombal/
├── Bin/         # Executable scripts and the main application launcher.
├── Doc/         # Project documentation, guides, and specifications.
├── Image/       # Logos, icons, and other image assets (like our butterfly!).
├── Lib/         # Core Raku libraries and modules for the project.
├── t/           # Automated tests (written in Raku).
└── README.md    # You are here!
```

- **`Bin`**: Contains the main executable files for the project. You can run the primary tool from here.
- **`Doc`**: All developer and user documentation resides here. Look inside for detailed guides on **IDECombal** and our
  development files.
- **`Image`**: Contains visual assets for the project, including our community butterfly logo.
- **`Lib`**: The heart of the project. This directory holds the Raku source code (`.rakumod` files) that powers our
  tools.
- **`t`**: All tests go here. We use Raku's built-in testing capabilities to ensure code quality.
